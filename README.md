Kaleidoscope
------------

Kaleidoscope is a [tutorial language for working with LLVM](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html); if you want more information about the language itself, please reference that tutorial.

This repository contains code which parses the same language as Kaleidoscope. It is meant to improve the architecture and algorithms of the underlying code, not improve the language itself. This is because this is my first compiler project, and I am trying to learn about the technology that creates languages, not languages themselves.

Right now only the code through [](chapter 2) has been implemented.
